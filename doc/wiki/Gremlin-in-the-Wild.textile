This section provides an overview of the groups using Gremlin. If you use Gremlin and you are not on this list, please add yourself. If you don't have a "GitHub":http://github.com account, then email your usecase to us and we can add it.

* "AT&Ti":http://attinteractive.com: Using Gremlin to manage their graph database backend and to evaluate recommendation algorithms. Other "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com packages that are used are "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com, "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com, and "Rexster":http://rexster.tinkerpop.com.

* "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org: Embedding Gremlin as one of the languages to interact with the "Neo4j Server":http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Getting_Started_With_Neo4j_Server and embedding the Blueprints and Tinkerpop components as part of the "main server distribution":http://neo4j.org/download.

* "Bulbflow":http://bulbflow.com: Bulbs is a Python persistence framework for graph databases that connects to Rexster, and it enables you to run Gremlin queries against any Blueprints-enabled database.  Bulbflow is a Python toolkit for building Web applications that is based on Bulbs and "Flask":http://flask.pocoo.org/. 

* "AgentSpring":https://github.com/alfredas/AgentSpring/wiki: AgentSpring is an agent-based modeling and simulation framework that uses a graph to represent the simulated environment. It uses Gremlin to query the simulated world and mine it for patterns. 

* "Social Networks in Archival Context (SNAC)":http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/: SNAC is an NEH funded research project this is trying to "unlock" the historical social network relationships that exist in descriptions of archival collections.  Gremlin and rexster are used to power interactive graph visualizations.  "Gremlin code":https://code.google.com/p/eac-graph-load/ and graph database (released as graphML) are open source.
