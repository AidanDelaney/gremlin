  <artifactId>gremlin</artifactId>
  <version>0.6</version>
</dependency>
```

* Fixed @foreach@ bug that occurred on single object looping
* Fixed @if/else@ bug that occurred on function call
* @null@ and empty iterator/iterable result now printed in console
* Empty path expression returns an empty iterable, not @null@
* Added @g:copy-e()@ function that conveniently copies an element from one graph into another
* Fixed numerous bugs in how functions were computing atoms
* GPath optimization through auto-reset of Gremlin-specific range-based pipes
* Comparing numbers is now possible without casting
* Fixed a major bug in error message handling (many exceptions w/o message being provided in console)
* Improved Gremlin evaluator load time with static function and step loading
* Added support for Blueprints 0.3 multi-indexes
** @g:add-aidx-key()@, @g:add-idx()@, @g:drop-idx()@, @g:show-aidx-keys()@, @g:show-idx()@, @g:remove-aidx-keys()@
* Added @return ?object@ to return from a user defined function or step
* Added support for path generation through @g:path()@ (main body of work in "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com)

h3. Version 0.5.5 (Gremlivich -- October 28, 2010)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>gremlin</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.5</version>
</dependency>
```

* A rework of the user-defined step model
** Renamed the concept of "path" to "step"
** Users can now define computations in steps
* Added @gather@ and @scatter@ steps to allow for aggregation and unrolling of objects within a path
* Added @g:append()@ function to concatenate objects to an iterable (e.g. list, set)

h3. Version 0.5 (Gremlivich -- September 22, 2010)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>gremlin</artifactId>
  <version>0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

Gremlin 0.5 "JavaDocs":http://tinkerpop.com/maven2/com/tinkerpop/gremlin/0.5/api/

* A complete redesign and implementation of the Gremlin compiler
** Compiler written using "ANTLR 3.2":http://www.antlr.org/
** Virtual machine written using "Pipes 0.1":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com and "JSR 223":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223.
* Significant performance improvements
** Order of magnitude increase in speed for numerous operations
** Lazy evaluation for better memory usage
* @Functions@ implement the @ServiceLoader@ pattern for ease of incorporating 3rd-party extensions
* Numerous changes to the Gremlin function library
** All core functions are now in the @g@ namespace (e.g. @g:count()@, @g:string()@)
** @g:id()@ changed to @g:id-v()@ and @g:id-e()@ for getting vertices and edges, respectively
** @g:key()@ changed to @g:key-v()@
** Added @g:version()@ function to retrieve version information
** Added @g:g()@ (group) to semi-replace @()@ model in Gremlin 0.2.2
** Added @g:flatten()@ to flatten embedded iterables
** Added @g:includes()@ to determine if an object is in an iterable
** Added @g:power()@ to implement raising a number by a power
** Added @g:range()@ to allow for integer ranges to be created
** Changed @g:difference()@ to @g:diff()@ (abbreviation policy enacted for function names)
** Added @g:set()@ to create a set (unordered, unique collection of objects)
** Added @g:integer()@, @g:long()@, @g:float()@, and @g:double()@ to support number casting
* Additions to the Gremlin type system
** Supports iterable as a super type in order to have direct support for lazy evaluation
** Supports set as an unordered, unique collection of objects
** Supports integer (1), long (1l), float (1.0), double (1.0d) as different number types
* Print streams can be dynamically set in @GremlinScriptContext@
* @true()@, @false()@, and @null()@ are now keywords--@true@, @false@, @null@
* String concatenation is supported with the @+@ operation
* Range filter support through @[1..10]@ type syntax
* Index of lists starts at 0 instead of 1 as in Gremlin 0.2.2
* Test cases now provide performance statistics
* Removed the 'show all aspects' * step (i.e. @./outE/inV/*@)
* Allow for the use of assignment and other operations within a path (e.g. @./outE/inV[g:p($x := .)@]
* Provided support for OrientDB graph database (main body of work in "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com)
* Update to dependency inclusions
** Distribution includes all supported graph databases in Blueprints (@gremlin-*-standalone.jar@)
** Dependency provide @<scope>provided</scope>@
