Many times its important to determine how many times a particular element is traversed over. That is, determine the flow through an element. Particular examples include:

* "Rank my friends friends by how many friends we share in common."
* "Rank items by how many people, who like the same things I like, like them."

```text
gremlin> software = []
gremlin> software.addAll(g.idx(T.v)[[lang:'java']])
==>true
gremlin> software                                  
==>v[3]
==>v[5]
```

Vertices @v[3]@ and @v[5]@ are software projects. Lets determine who is on the most software projects. In other words, lets traverse out of these vertices and see which developer vertices get the most flow.

```text
gremlin> software.inE('created').outV.name.groupCount.cap>>1  
==>marko=1
==>peter=1
==>josh=2
```

Josh received the most traversals through him. The @groupCount@ step maintains an internal @Map<Object,Long>@. The @cap@ step is used to "cap" @groupCount@ and have it emit its internal map, not the elements that flow through it. The following example better explains "capping" by demonstrating what happens when its not used.

```text
gremlin> m = [:]
gremlin> software.inE('created').outV.name.groupCount(m)
==>marko
==>josh
==>peter
==>josh
gremlin> m
==>marko=1
==>josh=2
==>peter=1
```

Here is a more complicated example using the @loop@ step and the Grateful Dead graph diagrammed in [[Defining a More Complex Property Graph]]. 

```text
g = new TinkerGraph()
GraphMLReader.inputGraph(g, new FileInputStream('data/graph-example-2.xml'))
```

The example below will continue to loop until a counter reaches 1000 (so the loop doesn't continue indefinitely). The loop will walk the outgoing edges of a vertex and update the flow map @m@. What is returned is how many times each song is traversed when starting from vertex @12@ (Me and My Uncle). Note that @g.v(12)@ is not a pipe, so the looping only happens over @outE.inV.name.groupCount(m).back(2)@. Finally @filter{false}@ is appended so no results are outputted to the terminal.

```text
gremlin> c = 0                                                                
==>0
gremlin> m = [:]                                                              
gremlin> g.v(12).outE.inV.name.groupCount(m).back(2).loop(3){c++ < 1000}.filter{false}
gremlin> m
