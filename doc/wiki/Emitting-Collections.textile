A common use case is to explore and emit two paths at the same time. Using the simple toy graph diagrammed in [[Defining a Property Graph]], an example is provided below.

```text
gremlin> g = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph()
==>tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]
gremlin> g.V.transform{[it.name, it.outE.inV.name >> []]}
==>[lop, []]
==>[vadas, []]
==>[marko, [vadas, lop, josh]]
==>[peter, [lop]]
==>[ripple, []]
==>[josh, [ripple, lop]]
```

This @transform@ above creates an array that contains the vertex name and the name of the vertices connected to that vertex.
