The Gremlin type system is simple. The following diagram represents each type in Gremlin and its inheritance relationship within a simple type hierarchy.

* *graph*: a graph is composed of a set of vertices and a set of edges.
* *vertex*: a vertex is composed of a set of outgoing edges, incoming edges, and a map of properties.
* *edge*: an edge is composed of an outgoing vertex, incoming vertex, and a map of properties.
* *boolean*: a boolean can either be true or false.
* *number*: a number can be an integer (6), a long (6l), a float (6.0), or a double (6.0d).
* *string*: a string is an array of characters.
* *list*: a list is an ordered collection of objects and allows for duplicates.
* *set*: a set is an unordered collection of objects and doesn't allow for duplicates
* *map*: a map is an "associative array":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array from a set of object keys to a collection of object values.
