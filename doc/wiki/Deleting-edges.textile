The Blueprints interface provides a removeEdge method that Gremlin can call.

For example, say we need to delete all 'DEPENDS_ON' edges from the tail vertices of the incoming edges of vertex 4883:

```
gremlin> g.v(4883).inE.outV.outE("DEPENDS_ON").each{ g.removeEdge(it) }
gremlin> 
```

Gremlin doesn't return a result for this operation, but we can verify that the operation succeeded by attempting to aggregate the results of the initial query: 

```
gremlin> x = []
gremlin> g.v(4883).inE.outV.outE("DEPENDS_ON").aggregate(x)
gremlin> x.size()
==> 0
```
