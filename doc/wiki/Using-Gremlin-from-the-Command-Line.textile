Gremlin scripts can be executed from the command line. To do so, simply create a Gremlin script file. The current convention is that Gremlin script files have an extension @grm@. Below is an example script called @example.grm@.

bc. for(i in 1..3)
  println i

Now you can evaluate the script using @gremlin.sh@ with the parameter for @-e@ being set to the script to execute.

bc. marko$ ./gremlin.sh -e example.grm 
1
2
3
marko$
