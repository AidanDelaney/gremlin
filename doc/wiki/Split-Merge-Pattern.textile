Most Gremlin pipelines are serial in that one step feeds to the next, so on and so forth. There are situations where it is desirable to split a pipeline and thus, have two parallel steps that are later merged back into a serial flow.

The steps @copySplit@, @fairMerge@ and @exhaustMerge@ make this possible.
