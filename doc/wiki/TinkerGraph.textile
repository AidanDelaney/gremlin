TinkerGraph is a lightweight in-memory property graph that serves as the reference implementation of the property graph model provided by "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com. If you have a small graph (bound by the limits of main memory), then TinkerGraph can be a handy graph to use with Gremlin.

The following is the list of @tg@ namespaces functions that are provided with the Gremlin distribution.

# "TinkerGraph Functions":#tg_functions
  ** @graph tg:open()@

h2(#tg_functions). TinkerGraph Functions

h3. Open @graph tg:open()@

This function creates a new TinkerGraph instance in memory.
