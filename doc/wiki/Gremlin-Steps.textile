Gremlin comes with a collection of predefined steps. Gremlin steps map to a particular @Pipe@ in "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com. A @Pipe<S,E>@ extends @Iterator<E>@ and @Iterable<E>@. It takes an object of type @S@ and emits and object of type @E@. Chaining pipes together creates a @Pipeline@. In essence, Gremlin is a "DSL":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language for constructing @Pipeline@ objects.

h1. Step Library

There is a structure to steps. This structure is articulated in the itemization below. All steps can be categorized as either being transform-, filter-, or sideEffect-based.

* @step@: a generic, general-purpose computational step.
** @transform@: take an object and emit a transformation of it.
** @filter@: decide whether to allow an object to pass or not.
** @sideEffect@: pass the object, but yield some side effect.

h3. Notes

  * If a pipe's argument is postfixed with a @?@, then the argument is optional. When no argument is provided, a reasonable default argument is created.
  * The steps @[key:value]@, @[key:[T,value]]@, and @propFilter(key,T,value)@ map to @LabelFilterPipe(value, Filter)@ or @IdFilterPipe(value, Filter)@ when the @key@ equals "label" or "id", respectively.
  * The @filter?@ column denotes whether a closure is allowed after the step name. If a closure is provided, the closure is passed to a @ClosureFilterPipe@. The closure must return "Groovy truth":http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/Groovy+Truth which determines whether the @it@ element is filtered or not. E.g. @outE{ it.weight > 0.5 }@.
  * If you come up a with a generally useful step/pipe and would like to include it into the main Gremlin distribution, please make an "issue":https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/issues or provide the appropriate pull request.

h1. Groovy and Steps

In many situations, a step looks like an object property from a Java/Groovy perspective. In fact, each step is a method. However, by using the "metaprogramming":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming facilities offered by Groovy, its possible to "trick" Groovy into thinking that a property is a method. For example, assume the following pipeline:

```java
v.outE.inV.name
```

This can be re-written in more Java/Groovy friendly syntax as:

```java
v.outE().inV().name
```

In the first example, when Groovy realizes that @outE@ is not a property of @v@, it calls the @propertyMissing@ method of the @MetaClass@ of @Vertex@. Gremlin uses this method to say "oh, @outE@ is not a property, its a method. Let me resolve that method and return its value." At which point, Gremlin returns the running @Pipeline@ with the new @OutEdgePipe@ appended to it.

There are many situations in which calling the method instead of the property representation of a @Pipe@ is necessary.
