Gremlin provides the ability for a user to define their own step definitions natively in Groovy or in Java. This is very useful when wishing to work with your low-level graph data at a higher level of abstraction.  This section will discuss how to write your own step definitions and demonstrate how they are useful for making your Gremlin code more concise and more self-explanatory.

h2(#definegremlin). Defining a Step in Gremlin

Gremlin comes with a collection of built-in step definitions (see [[Gremlin Steps]]). It is possible for developers to create their own step definitions. Simply add a closure that represents the step to the respective classes. The method to use is:

```text
Gremlin.defineStep(String stepName, List<Class> classes, Closure stepClosure);
```

```text
Gremlin.defineStep('codeveloper',[Vertex,Pipe], {_().sideEffect{x = it}.out('created').in('created'){!x.equals(it)}})
```

In the code above, the final argument is a closure to create the desired composite step. The step closure says:

  * Save the current vertex to the variable @x@
  * Get the outgoing @created@ vertices of the current vertex.
  * Get the incoming @created@ vertices of those previous vertices.
  * Exclude the first vertex from the path (a person can not be a codeveloper of themselves)

Given the graph diagrammed in [[Defining a Property Graph]], we can determine the codevelopers of a particular vertex.

```text
gremlin> g = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph()
==>tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]
gremlin> g.v(1).codeveloper
==>v[4]
==>v[6]
```

Realize that this step definition can be used like any other step definition.

```text
gremlin> g.v(1).codeveloper.name
==>josh
==>peter
```

What step definitions allow you to do is to work with "higher order" relationships in your graph. Thus, instead of working at the level of 

```text
_().sideEffect{x = it}.out('created').in('created'){x != it}
```

you can work at the more semantically natural level of

```text
codeveloper
```

It is also possible to pass in parameters to a step definition. For example, lets generalize @codeveloper@ to simply be @co@.

```text
Gremlin.defineStep('co',[Vertex,Pipe], {String label -> _().sideEffect{x = it}.out(label).in(label){!x.equals(it)}})
```

In the above step definition, upon evaluating the step, the step expects a @String@ parameter to be passed into it. Thus, in order to properly evaluate the @co@ step do the following:

```text
gremlin> g.v(1).co('created')
==>v[4]
==>v[6]
```

Finally, realize that the parameters passed to the step can be closures. Thus, it is possible to effect dynamic behavior.

```text
def x;
Gremlin.defineStep('twoStep', [Pipe, Vertex], { final Object... params ->  _().sideEffect{x = it}.out(params[0]).in(params[0]).filter(params[1]) });
```

```text
gremlin> g.v(1).twoStep('created'){it != x}
==>v[4]
==>v[6]
gremlin> g.v(1).twoStep('created'){it == x}
==>v[1]
```

h2(#defineanony). Defining an Anonymous Step in Gremlin

You can also create an anonymous step (or "lambda step") using the @step@ step. For example:

```text
gremlin> g = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph()    
==>tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]
gremlin> g.v(1).out.step{ s().map() }
==>{name=vadas, age=27}
==>{name=lop, lang=java}
==>{name=josh, age=32}
```

The method @s()@ is equivalent to @starts.next()@ which is defined in "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com and represents the next end of the previous pipe. For those familiar with Pipes, the provided @step@ closure becomes the method @AbstractPipe.processNextStart()@. 

h2(#definejava). Defining a Step in Java

To ensure speed, it is possible to define steps in Java and then load the paths using @import@. Here is the previous @codeveloper@ path written in Java as a pipe (see "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com).

```java
public class CoDeveloperPipe extends Pipeline<Vertex,Vertex> {
  public CoDeveloperPipe() {
     List singleObjectList = new ArrayList() {
            public boolean add(Object object) {
                this.clear();
                super.add(object);
                return true;
            }
        };
     Pipe pipe0 = new AggregatorPipe(singleObjectList);
     Pipe pipe1 = new OutPipe("created");
     Pipe pipe2 = new InPipe("created");
     Pipe pipe3 = new ObjectFilterPipe(pipe0.getSideEffect(), Filter.EQUALS);
     this.setPipes(pipe0, pipe1, pipe2, pipe3);
   }
}
```

Make sure that this class is in your Java classpath. If so, you can now include this newly created step/pipe in Gremlin.

```text
Gremlin.defineStep('codeveloper', [Vertex,Pipe], { new CoDeveloperPipe() });
```
