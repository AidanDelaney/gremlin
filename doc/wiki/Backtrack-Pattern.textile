Many times its desirable to traverse a particular path and if some criteria is met along that path, then go back to the element from n-steps ago. Examples of such uses cases include:

* "What is the age of my friends who have friends who are older than 30 years old?"
* "What other products have my friends purchased who have also purchased a product of type X?"

```text
g = TinkerGraphFactory.createTinkerGraph()
```

The query below says, in plain English: "What are the ages of the people that know people that are 30+ years old?" The call to @back(4)@ refers to the elements 4 steps ago that have paths up to the @back(4)@ step (i.e. back to the @V@ step). In the example below, @back(4)@ "wraps" @outE[label:'knows'].inV{it.age > 30}@.

```text
gremlin> g.V.outE[[label:'knows']].inV{it.age > 30}.back(4).age
==>29
```

A more complicated example is provided over the Grateful Dead graph diagrammed in [[Defining a More Complex Property Graph]].

```text
g = new TinkerGraph()
GraphMLReader.inputGraph(g, new FileInputStream('data/graph-example-2.xml'))
```

The example query below states the following:

* get the song with id @89@ (Dark Star).
* get all the songs that follow Dark Star in concert.
* get the singers of those songs.
* filter to only those songs that are sung by Jerry Garcia.
* go back 4 steps to yield those songs that follow Dark Star and are sung by Jerry Garcia.
* get the names of those songs that follow Dark Star and are sung by Jerry Garcia.

```text
gremlin> g.v(89).outE[[label:'followed_by']].inV.outE[[label:'sung_by']].inV[[name:'Garcia']].back(4).name
==>EYES OF THE WORLD
==>SING ME BACK HOME
==>MORNING DEW
==>HES GONE
==>CHINA DOLL
==>WHARF RAT
==>BROKEDOWN PALACE
==>TERRAPIN STATION
==>DEAL
==>ATTICS OF MY LIFE
==>COMES A TIME
==>STELLA BLUE
==>BERTHA
```

In order to determine how many steps to go back, the @GremlinPipeline.toString()@ can be handy for displaying all the steps in an expression.

```text
gremlin> println g.v(89).outE[[label:'followed_by']].inV.outE[[label:'sung_by']].inV[[name:'Garcia']]     
[VertexEdgePipe<OUT_EDGES>, LabelFilterPipe<NOT_EQUAL,followed_by>, EdgeVertexPipe<IN_VERTEX>, VertexEdgePipe<OUT_EDGES>, LabelFilterPipe<NOT_EQUAL,sung_by>, EdgeVertexPipe<IN_VERTEX>, PropertyFilterPipe<name,NOT_EQUAL,Garcia>]
==>null
```

Now, using the @back@ step, notice how @back(4)@ wraps 4 pipes prior to it. The name of the pipe in Pipes is @FutureFilterPipe@.

```text
gremlin> println g.v(89).outE[[label:'followed_by']].inV.outE[[label:'sung_by']].inV[[name:'Garcia']].back(4).name
[VertexEdgePipe<OUT_EDGES>, LabelFilterPipe<NOT_EQUAL,followed_by>, EdgeVertexPipe<IN_VERTEX>, FutureFilterPipe<[VertexEdgePipe<OUT_EDGES>, LabelFilterPipe<NOT_EQUAL,sung_by>, EdgeVertexPipe<IN_VERTEX>, PropertyFilterPipe<name,NOT_EQUAL,Garcia>]>, PropertyPipe<name>]
==>null
```
