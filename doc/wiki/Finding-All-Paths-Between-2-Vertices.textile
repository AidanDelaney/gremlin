Assuming:

* @A@ : id of the starting vertex
* @B@ : id of the ending vertex
* @N@ : maximum number of loops

h2. To find all paths in a directed graph:

```groovy
g.v(A).out.loop(1){it.loops<=N && !(it.object.id in [A,B])}.filter{it.id==B}.paths
```

h2. To find all paths in an undirected graph:

```groovy
g.v(A).both.loop(1){it.loops<=N && !(it.object.id in [A,B])}.filter{it.id==B}.paths
```
