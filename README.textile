Gremlin is a domain specific language for traversing property "graphs":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29. Gremlin makes use of "Pipes":http://pipes.tinkerpop.com to perform complex graph traversals. This language has application in the areas of graph query, analysis, and manipulation. Connectors, provided by "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com, exist for the following graph management systems:
